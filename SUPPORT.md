# Getting support

## GitHub issues
We choose not to use GitHub issues for general usage questions and support, preferring to use issues solely for the tracking of bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question please do not open a GitHub issue, but use one of the other channels described below.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem.

## GitHub discussions
If you have a question or want to discuss specific things related to the library, you can use [discussion forum](https://github.com/ingogriebsch/sync-packagejson-version-maven-plugin/discussions). Please do not report a bug through this forum, but use the GitHub issues instead.

## Stack Overflow
The community monitors the [sync-packagejson-version-maven-plugin](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/sync-packagejson-version-maven-plugin) tag on Stack Overflow. Before asking a question, please familiarize yourself with Stack Overflow's [advice on how to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Gitter
If you want to discuss something or have a question that isn't suited to Stack Overflow, the community chat in the [#sync-packagejson-version-maven-plugin room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ingogriebsch/sync-packagejson-version-maven-plugin).
